## Executive Summary
This report presents an analysis and evaluation of a new information system for a major travel company.

### Problem Definition
The current system for a Call Management Centre is inefficient. Both potential and existing customers are matched to Relationship Managers according to availability. As a result, the time of the Relationship Managers is not being used efficiently and customers have to wait longer to talk to a Relationship Manager. Consequently, customers are less likely to accept an offered product and sales are reduced. A new system is to be developed to increase the amount of customers and the likelihood of customers purchasing products.

### Objectives
- Reduce the average customer waiting time
- Reduce the amount of customers hanging up from a busy line
- Increase the total target customers purchasing products
- Increase the total existing customers purchasing products
- Increase the total customer intake

### Methods and Data Sources
The methods of analysis and evaluation used are Use Cases, Use Case Diagrams, Activity Diagrams, Class Diagrams and Collaboration Diagrams.
